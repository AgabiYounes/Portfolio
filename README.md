## Overview
Because downloading and using ready-made templates is quite a boring procedure ðŸ˜’, I decided to code my portfolio from Scratch using Vue.js CLI and pure CSS ðŸ˜Ž using flex and grid system for a responsive design and an SPA web app. You can improve it or/and use it freely to create your own portfolio...
